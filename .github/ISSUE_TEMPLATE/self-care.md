•	Improved physical health – Proper nutrition, exercise, and rest help prevent chronic illnesses and boost immunity.
•	Enhanced mental clarity – Taking breaks and engaging in stimulating activities help maintain focus and cognitive function.
•	Reduced stress and anxiety – Mindfulness, deep breathing, and relaxation techniques help regulate emotions.

Common Misconceptions About Self-Care
1.	Self-care is selfish – Prioritizing oneself is not an act of selfishness; rather, it enables individuals to be more present and effective in their relationships and responsibilities.
2.	Self-care is expensive – While luxury spa treatments and vacations are appealing, self-care can be as simple as deep breathing exercises, journaling, or taking a walk in nature.
3.	Self-care requires a lot of time – Even small, consistent actions like a five-minute gratitude practice or a 10-minute stretch session can significantly impact well-being.
4.	Self-care is only about relaxation – While rest is a crucial part of self-care, it also includes physical activity, nutrition, personal growth, and emotional resilience.
